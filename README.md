# 💫 About Me:
I am a **Computer Engineering** senior and **Machine Learning Engineer** with a deep fascination for the mathematical foundations of AI. I don't just use models; I build them from the ground up and keep my edge by following the latest SOTA research.<br><br>🔬 Research & Deep Learning Focus<br>- **SOTA Reader:** I keep my skills up to date by actively following and implementing State-of-the-Art research from top-tier conferences.<br>- **From Scratch Development:** I enjoy building architectures from the ground up—including **LLMs (Transformer blocks, attention mechanisms)** and **Computer Vision** backbones—to truly understand the underlying gradients.<br>- **Graduation Thesis:** Architecting a **3D Protein Conditional Diffusion Model** for binder design<br><br>👁️ Computer Vision & Robotics<br>- **TEKNOFEST (EGE ROV Team Leader):** Led the AI development for an underwater vehicle. Engineered real-time object detection and tracking systems using **OpenCV** and custom-trained models for challenging underwater environments.<br>- **Medical AI:** Optimized a **3D CNN** for Glioblastoma diagnosis at BMG Lab, outperforming standard ResNet/DenseNet architectures (85% F1-Score).<br><br>🏗️ AI Agent & MLOps<br>- 🤖 **End-to-end AI Agent:** Building end-to-end LLM agents with **RAG**, FastAPI, and Docker on AWS.<br><br>🛠 Tech Stack<br>- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow,  FastAPI, <br>- **MLOps & Cloud:** Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, AWS (Certified Cloud Practitioner)<br>- **CV & Robotics:** OpenCV, Kalman Filters (LSTM-RNN enhanced)<br>
